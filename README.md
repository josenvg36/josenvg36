### Welcome to my Git! 👋

Hey! My name is Jose, I'm a Mechanical Engineer with experience in ship thruster ⚓ and food processing machinery 🍗 installation and maintenance.  Looking to bridge the gap between engineering and software development, I'm currently at 42 Warsaw, focusing on mastering the C programming language🐤.

This profile showcases projects that combine my engineering background with my developing coding skills. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!💬
